<h1>Savukku Shankar - a bio pic</h1>

<p>This is just a fabulous and interesting story of an incapable rowdy who fits into the frame of a &quot;rowdy&quot; in the behest of the murders and crime committed by others.</p>

<p>From a fake government kumastha to a prolific writer of social media,  a loafer and pimp to DMK Sabareesan, his journey is a milestone of slut and slime- he’s none but Savukku Sankar as he is called . To pen his story we need also to unfurl  the people  who have instigated him . On that road , it’s the cuckold T N Gopalan and Kavitha Muralidaran,  who has an untold conspicuous fairy tale relationship with Gopalan, J. Stalin the former journalist of Junior Vikatan , Times Now reporter Shabeer Ahmed , Barathitamizhan who loots the Press club money and also lure the “ maamis” in the pressclub, Kishore K Samy , Former police official Durairaj , Saradha who is an employee of the tamilnadu Vigilance and anti corruption  department and Devi who’s also employed there.</p>

<img src="/archive/2021/03/01/akviswanathan.jpg" class="img-responsive">

<p>The rip off artist - kumastha Savukku Shankar’s first wife Sudha , Second lover Shanthi, third wife Nilavumozhi Senthamarai , his clandestine lover Latha Prabhu , an advocate lover from egmore , a broker’s broker Anbazhagan Veerapan, his clandestine lover Arulmozhi chellaih, journalists like Kosalram and Peer Mohammed, Junior Vikatan’s former editor Vikesh , Vaidyanathan- editor of Dinamani, Commissioner of chennai A K Viswanathan , Former DGP Ashokkumar , Director of CBI Arunachalam , IG of vigilance and anti corruption I G Murugan , Advocate N R Ilango , Advocate Ramesh Natarajan , Manikandan vaathan chettiyar, Advocate Radhakrishnan , Pugazhenthi , Sundararajan , Mahalakshmi , Panimalar Paneerselvam’s life stories cannot in anyway be sidestepped . Each one them is a reason in one way or another in the graph of an ordinary swindler to a dhadda  savukku sankar .  A few in the above list have used innocent people as pawns in Shankar’s games . But what is interesting is - those who have helped him have also faced incursion from his end.</p>

<p>He is a facade of many who couldn’t show off their revenge in public. Shankar’s employment was not attained through proper doors. The website he runs is not his own. He doesn’t maintain the server too. The telephone tape which he is accused of leaking has not been done by him. It’s not him who detected the miscalculations in Kumarasamy’s case of acquisition of wealth.</p>

<img src="/archive/2021/03/01/ashokkumar.jpg" class="img-responsive">

<p>Then who actually unveiled it ?</p>

<p>Shankar’s father Aachimuthu died when he was serving as a police . In norms of empathy , Shankar got the posting when he was studying his tenth standard . Based on his educational qualification he was assigned a clerical job. Nothing but to while away the time in carrying the files from one table to another and arranging them - Shankar had no other reasonable work to do. He but developed a close nexus with few officials who also had a vice versa faith in him - He also develops a close connect with Sharadha and Devi - whatever party rules the government - it’s the game of the government officials ultimately that reigns . In the tenure of Kalaignar’s rule in 2006 - there was helluva issues amidst the police officials.</p>

<p>Shankar owns to have leaked out the telephonic conversation of the then Chief secretary S K Thirupathy and The commissioner of Vigilance and anti corruption Ubaathyaayaa and crowning this for his benefits he still earns his bread emphasising this even after years.</p>

<img src="/archive/2021/03/01/sarunachalam.jpg" class="img-responsive">

<p>What was then  the real scenario ?</p>

<p>It was a counter blow of defaming a group of police officials by another . To execute this , the concerned Police official is in search of a courier boy. That means he was searching for a trustworthy slave Amidst the department. And finally they located Savukku Shankar. He was just a broker in the game of  this  drama of telephone leak out operation .That became a hot selling cake then of the journals. But the most important interesting fact is that it is totally illogical For a labourer to claim a money that has been handed over by his proprietor as his own . Tragically Shankar owns the whole operation as his till date . And to remain safe in their side,The police accuses Shankar to be the brainchild behind this telephone leak out operation and The journalists hailed him as a hero who unravelled police undercover strategies.</p>

<img src="/archive/2021/03/01/igmurugan.jpg" class="img-responsive">

<p>The enquiry conducted by the police department was very interesting -“ we know that you don’t have the calibre to even enter the space of looting the tape nor are you in the position of even entering that particular space. So we strongly believe that you can never ever do this act. So just tell usWho the real culprit is – the police officials who interrogated Shankar asked him this. But never single time did he disclose the name of the official because he knew very well The consequences if he would open up with the officials name. Rather he was too confident that he would get a abundant amount of money from the officer. But eat melted into nothingness. Thus  evolved A broker and an informer in the police department in the personification of Savukku  Shankar. To glorify him in decent words he is the glorified pimp of the department. As already said the leakage of the telephonic conversation of a few officials by other officials was done With an ulterior motive. The only agenda was to get into the good books of Jayalalithaa. Also to Outstripped certain senior police officials. The real plethora behind this is no official had the real guts to expose all these in public. And hence Shankar was chosen as a courier boy. Shankar released this breaking news with the help of peer Mohammad ( Deccan Chronicle) and Vikesh (Junior Vikatan).</p>

<p>And now comes the most interesting question – who is that official. Shankar never revealed who it was in the police enquiry but had opened it up Umpteen times when ever he was intoxicated. It was none but the present Commissioner of Chennai AK Viswanathan - he has sworn. And after I was cornered in this case never did that person A K Viswanathan attended my phone call- he had blabbered. Never have I seen him after that was his confession.</p>

<p>As of now many journalists from Chennai have been secret flatterers of AK Viswanathan. They flatter him through WhatsApp group and Facebook pages. For many this has been there full time job and being a journalist is just a part Time one. This group is headed by Tamil online Muthaleep , Times of India Selvaraj , And the all-time Broker of Savukku Shankar- Anbazhagan Veerapan .When these people have once revealed to Shanker that AK Viswanathan is a good fellow Shankar retorted – oh.. is that person very good? If then why was he appointed as the Chennai Commissioner of police during RK Nagar by-elections. He is a devotee of eddapadi Palanichamy. That is why he is  appointed the commissioner of Chennai.</p>

<p>Thus ends the story - with unveiling the hero of the telephonic leakage - AK Viswanathan.</p>
